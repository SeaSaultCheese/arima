    <h1>The Present and Future of Air Quality Research in the Era of Big Data: A Case Study of Five Major Cities in China</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In today's wave of scientific research, big data analytics and IoT data have become key tools for
solving complex problems, providing researchers with unprecedented insights. The combination of   the two is not only driving innovation in the field of science, but also providing us with new ways to understand and solve global problems. Among them, atmospheric pollution has attracted widespread
attention as a global challenge that is not only a focus of scientific inquiry, but also of societal concern.</p>
<p>One of the main components of air pollution is PM2.5, which is composed of air particles with a
pneumatic diameter of less than 2.5 micrometer[1]. They can have adverse effects on human health and can
have lasting negative effects on many aspects of agriculture, climate, ecosystems, and society[1].In
China, five cities - Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Shenyang - are located in the most
economically dynamic regions of the country, together accounting for more than 50% of China's gross domestic product (GDP)[1]. Therefore, it is important to assess the air quality of the five major cities   to understand their patterns and trends and to provide a highly representative summary of PM2.5
pollution in China[1].</p>
    <p>The core issue of this study is to summarize the existing data as well as to explore the relationship between PM2.5 concentrations and environmental factors and meteorological conditions. The
resolution of this relationship not only helps us to understand more comprehensively the mechanisms of air pollution formation and evolution, but also provides an important scientific basis for the
formulation of targeted environmental policies.</p>
<p>Through the in-depth study of this relationship, we are expected to promote the development of air quality monitoring and management on a global scale, and provide a cleaner and healthier living
environment for human beings. With the support of big data and IoT technologies, we will gain a   more comprehensive and precise insight into the nature of the air pollution problem and lay a solid scientific foundation for building a more sustainable future society.</p>

<h2>Research Status</h2>
<p>1.  Related Technology</p>
<p>Data Visualization</p>
<p>Data visualization plays a crucial role in big data analytics by transforming raw data into information- rich graphics and revealing valuable insights from large and complex datasets[2] . While completing
the task of data analysis of hundreds of thousands of data regarding air pollution, it would be impossible without data visualization.
<p>Regression Analysis</p>
<p>Regression analysis is a statistical process for estimating the relationship between variables. It
consists of a number of techniques for modeling and analyzing multiple variables, focusing on the
relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or "predictor
variables") [3]. There are many other studies that have utilized this computational approach, however, it has rarely been used for air quality prediction due to the high complexity of air quality. In addition,
it still has accuracy problems: they can only predict general trends or short-term series. Once it  becomes a long-term prediction, there will be a gap between the actual values and the predicted results [4].</p>
<p>Forecasting</p>
<p>Forecasting is one of the most commonly used techniques for analyzing time series data, and the idea of forecasting is to use historical data to make predictions about future data[5]. And the forecasting
model uses the strategy of predicting the values of the data obtained from various datasets[5]. The
model includes classification, prediction, regression and analysis of time series. In this project, I will try different predictive models to predict the concentration of PM2.5.</p>
<p>Internet of Things sensor</p>
<p>As a system that can quickly exchange a large amount of information, the Internet of Things is widely used in cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence and other fields[6]. Nowadays, sensors have   become the producer of massive data in the era of the Internet of Things. The advantage of low-cost
sensor networks is that they can effectively narrow the huge gap between meteorological and air monitoring due to the lack of observation data[6].
In practical application, a set of automatic meteorological data acquisition system based on the
Internet of things can be designed: using the sensor data acquisition, the hub will each sensor data
aggregation to a line, and then connect the data line to the gateway, finally transferred to the gateway, the sensor data coupling processing, and through the 4G module uploaded to the server[7].</p>
<p>2. PM2.5 concentration affected by meteorological conditions</p>
<p>There have been many studies on the relationship between PM2.5 concentrations and other
meteorological conditions. The studies generally show that PM2.5 concentrations are inextricably linked to meteorological conditions.</p>
<p>Some scholars have studied the relationship between PM2.5 concentrations and wind direction in Beijing during the three-year period 2019-2021. The study showed that easterly winds upward
pollutant concentrations have a greater impact on air quality in Beijing [8]. Also in Beijing, there are  studies that use regression fitting and GAM modeling to conclude that PM2.5 concentrations increase as humidity increases, that average air temperature is positively correlated with PM2.5, and that
PM2.5 levels decrease relatively as wind speed increases ...... and so on [9]. Meanwhile, seasonal
factors are also considered as one of the reasons affecting PM2.5 concentration. One of the studies
using PM2.5 concentration and meteorological data as samples in Guiyang City showed that there are obvious seasonal differences in the changes of PM2.5 concentration [10]. Winter concentrations are    the most polluted season of the year, with the highest values occurring in December, and summer
concentrations are the lowest, with the lowest values occurring in July [10].</p>
<p>However, it is worth stating that PM2.5 concentrations measured at different locations at different times and the conclusions obtained can vary. The conclusions about what meteorological conditions  affect PM2.5 concentrations vary depending on the data source or location.</p>
<p>3. PM2.5 is affected by other factors</p>
<p>So some scholars think. Factors other than meteorological factors can also have a significant impact on the concentration of PM2.5.</p>
<p>One of them is geographic factors, which may affect the pollution dispersion conditions. For
example, Chengdu is located on the western edge of the Sichuan Basin, which is known for its lack of
wind and high humidity; Beijing has a mountain range to the west and a mountain range to the north, and relies heavily on the north wind to clean up pollution, which may lead to untimely pollution
dispersion in Beijing and Chengdu, creating higher PM2.5 concentrations [1]. In contrast, the situation in cities close to the sea may be much better.</p>
<p>The second is the anthropogenic factor.PM2.5 can come from heating fuels, industry,
transportation, etc. Because of China's rapid industrialization, high energy consumption, and a large
proportion of coal (60-70%) in the energy mix, different cities with different energy mixes or will
result in different PM2.5 concentrations [11]. The winter heating effect in northern cities is also a
reason for the increase in PM2.5 concentration. Northern China has cold winters, and most cities burn coal to heat indoors against the cold. The continuous burning of large amounts of coal, combined with the already poor ability to absorb and diffuse pollutants in winter, will lead to increased PM2.5
concentrations [12].</p>
<h2>Future trends</h2>
<p>Future air quality research will gradually move towards a more highly intelligent stage, and with the   continuous development of big data and IoT technologies, more accurate and real-time monitoring of the relationship between PM2.5 concentrations and meteorological conditions will be realized.
Machine learning, neural networks, and more advanced technologies will be used to monitor the data
in order to build more comprehensive models that will enable us to understand these complex relationships more deeply and propose effective management solutions [4, 13].</p>
<p>More emphasis will also be placed on multifactor analysis of PM2.5 concentrations, taking into
account the combined effects of geographic, anthropogenic, meteorological, and other factors. The
comprehensive factor analysis will help to understand the formation mechanism of PM2.5  concentration more comprehensively and provide a more scientific basis for environmental management.<p>
